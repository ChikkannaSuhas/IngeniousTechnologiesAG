FAQs

1). Why am I getting this error?

To reduce costs, we need to run our staging pods on pre-emptive nodes. The above yaml code ensures that your pod runs on pre-emptive nodes. 


2). Does it affect the pods/applications in any way, if they run on Pre-emptive nodes?

No, Pre-emptive nodes(VMs) are the same as standard nodes(VMs) but at reduced costs. And also pre-emptive nodes restart every 24hrs in the context of K8s. This cannot affect staging pods/applications in any way.
